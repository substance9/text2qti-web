# Getting Started

<!-- toc -->



This tool allows users to create the quiz in predefined markdown text format. It converts the text-format quiz into QTI-format ZIP file which could be imported to a Canvas course. You could either input the text in the text area or directly upload the text format file (with extension name .md or .txt)

The markdown-to-QTI conversion code running on backend is based on [text2qti](https://github.com/gpoore/text2qti) project by [Geoffrey Poore](https://github.com/gpoore). 

This help document aims to give learn-by-doing instructions by directly providing a template. The template include. The detailed specification for the format could be found at the original text2qti repo's [README document](https://github.com/gpoore/text2qti/blob/master/README.md)
